<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This module provides a HTML5 phone field that supports
the <code>tel:</code> schema that is available on most
recent smart-phones.</p>

<p>The HTML5 <code>tel:</code> schema is defined in 2004, in 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3966.txt">RFC3966: The tel
URI for Telephone Numbers</a>. For an update, see
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-current-state-of-telephone-links/">Geoff
Graham: The Current State of Telephone Links </a>.</p>
  
<h2>Using the module</h2>

<p>After the module has been enabled, a <em>Phone number</em> field
  becomes available and may be added to an entity bundle.  When you
do, a form for setting up the field (like the one shown below) appears.</p>

<div class="help-imgpos-center" style="max-width:540px">
<img class="help-img" alt="phonefield.png" title="Screendump" src="&path&phonefield.png" width="540" />
<div class="help-img-caption" style="max-width:540px">Form for setting up the phone field</div>
</div>

<p>A phone link label (e.g. “Call us”) for can be set to static,
optional, or no label.  If the label is optional, there will be a
translatable field for the label along with phone number field on each
entity instance.  If the label is static, the phone link will always
use the same label.  The static or default label is entered on the
form for editing the phone field settings for a particular entity.  A
static or default label cannot be translated.</p>

<p>The module provides four format options that can be selected in the
column “Format” under the “Manage display” tab.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Phone link (default): A phone link with the label used as anchor text.</li>
  <li>Label: phone link: The label is followed by a phone link with the phone number as anchor text.</li>
  <li>Label: phone number: The label is followed by the phone number (no link).</li>
  <li>Phone number: Only the phone number (no label, no link).</li>
</ol>

<p>If <code>hook_phonefield__supports_tel()</code> is implemented, and
it returns FALSE, a link will <em>not</em> be created, even if a
format option to create a link is choosen.</p>

<p>If the label is optional, and there is no default link label, the
phone number will be used as anchor text. When the number is used as
anchor text, the formatted version is shown, while the normalized
version of the number is used for phone links.</p>

<p>If you add a phone number field to the user entity, you may want to
prevent it from being dislayed as part of the user's public user
profile, by setting its display property to “Hidden”.</p>



<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>The phone field created by this module is a free format text field.
There is no provision for custom formatters or country codes.  The
module is intentionally lightweight on features. There is no
validation of the number entered.</p>

<p>While this may be perceived as a limitation by some, this also
means that you can enter a number that is human viewable confirming to
any local convention for displaying phone numbers, including hyphens
and brackets.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The <code>tel:</code>-link does not work.</strong><br/>
  Clicking on the <code>tel:</code>-produces no result, or produces an
  error message from the browser (e.g. “The address wasn’t understood”
  or “The webpage cannot be displayed”).<br/>  This is the standard
  behaviour if your device does not have a phone app.  The URL only
  works as expected on smartphones and similar devices.  To fall back
  on an alternative display for non-phone devices, you may create a
  custom module that
  implements <code>hook_phonefield__supports_tel()</code>.  See the
  next help page for a description of this hook.</li>
