## INTRODUCTION

The **Phone Field** project provides a phone field for Drupal 7 that
supports the HTML5 `tel:`-schema.

## REQUIREMENTS

* [**Advanced help hint**][1]:  
  To hint about getting `README.md` displayed as help.

## RECOMMENDED MODULES

* [**Advanced help**][2]:  
  When this module is enabled, additional on-screen help will be
  available when you visit `/admin/help/ah/phonefield`.
* [**Markdown**][4]:  
  When this module is enabled, the project's `README.md` will be
  rendered by the markdown filter, making it more readable on the
  screen.

## INSTALLATION

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: [Installing modules][5] for further information.

## CONFIGURATION

When you enable the module, the phone field will become available for
use (i.e. it can be added to entities).  The properties for a phone
field may be set when you add it to an entity.

For a more detailed description of the options, see the section “Using
the module” on the “General” help page.


## BUG REPORTS, SUPPORT REQUESTS, PATCHES

Help with development from the community (e.g. patches, reviews, bug
reports) are welcome.

Post bug reports, support requests, patches in the [project's issue
queue][3].

## RELATED MODULES

Depending on your requirements, you may consider one of these modules
as an alternative to this module.

* [**Phone**][6]:  
  Provides a very complex phone field, with validation and formatting
  for many the number plan om many countries.
* [**Phone Number**][7]:  
  Provides a very complex number field, with subtle differences
  compared to **Phone**.
* [**Telephone**][8]:  
  Similar to this module, as it provides an unvalidated phone field.
  However, the phone link label is not translatable, and it does not
  provide a normalized version of the phone number for searching and
  matching.
